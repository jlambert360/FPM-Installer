# Dependencies needed (install these first!)

## Arch based distros

`sudo pacman -Sy gcc8 gcc8-libs`

## Ubuntu 20.04 based distros
If running Ubuntu 20.04 or other distros based on it you must install this dep as well.

`sudo apt install libxxf86vm-dev libxmu-dev libgtk2.0-dev`

You must also tell the installer you are running it as well. 

## Other Deps

For most users (including Fedora 24+), see [this page](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Building_Dolphin_on_Linux) for an easy to install list of dependencies; otherwise, see below.

## NixOS: 

See [attached README, written by fletchers#4892](../other_distros/NixOS/INSTALL.md)

## Solus (possible list, untested):

`sudo eopkg it -c system.devel`

`sudo eopkg it libgtk-2-devel libgtk-3-devel wxwidgets-devel libsm-devel gtest-devel llvm-devel lzo-devel mbedtls-devel miniupnpc-devel libxrandr-devel libxi-devel alsa-lib-devel bluez-devel mesalib-devel curl-devel enet-devel libevdev-devel pulseaudio-devel libusb-devel openal-soft-devel portaudio-devel sdl2-devel SFML-devel soundtouch-devel git cmake pkg-config gcc readline-devel libxext-devel libao-devel`

## Thanks in part by:

The entire FasterMelee team, without their installer as a base, this would probably not have been written.

They thank the following people so it felt appropriate to thank them here as well:

    /u/ParadigmComplex. "Seriously, I could not have finished the original script without this guy."

    /u/jojorino and Hannesmann: "always testing and helping, as well as the rest of the FM discord!"

    "Also thanks to xanax, CilanMan, /u/algebra123230, /u/folfess for incremental improvements!"
